                    <p>You have developed a successful business model that has boosted you to your current position. However, too often the accounting system does not accurately reflect your business model. In consultation, Ms. Bailey will listen to how you do business and show you how to customize and simplfy your use of QuickBooks by guiding you in setting up your chart of accounts correctly to reflect GAAP standard accounting practices and your specific business questions. Ms. Bailey will teach you precisely what you want to know to make QuickBooks easier to manage, and your business more prosperous than it is today. Unlike a class or a seminar, she schedules sessions at your place of business. She works exclusively as a consultant, scheduling one client per afternoon, at your place of business, or by remote access. Her minimum is 4 hours. Please contact Intuits tech support for the answer to a single question.</p>

                    <h2>You want to be protected from fraud.</h2>
                    <p>You have invested your money and good name into capitalizing your business. You expect the people you hire to be well-qualified, and treat you with respect. But based on the report from the ACFE 2008 Report to the Nation on Occupational Fraud and Abuse, www.acfe.com, small businesses defined as those with less than 100 employees suffered both a greater percentage of frauds (38%) and a higher median loss ($200,000) than their larger counterparts. A good first step to understanding why fraud is committed is to study the fraud triangle, created by famed criminologist Donald Cressey. Each side of the triangle is an element of fraud opportunity, motivation, and rationalization. The fraud triangle explains why fraud occurs more often with high income earners and their bookkeepers.</p>

Recording what you own, what you owe, and your investment into the business produces a Balance Sheet a statement of the net worth.
