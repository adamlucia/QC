That's where a business analyst like Madeline Bailey comes in to play. Ms. Bailey has a B.A. in Management, plus 28 years of business management practice and expertise.

                    <p>Most CPA's provide accounting and tax filing services, but rarely enlighten you about the hundreds of ways you could improve your business profitability. It simply isn't their focus. Big accounting firms offer services comparable to ours but individual clients are assigned to the junior staff. Madeline Bailey is the "missing link", answering the call for a creative approach to improving profitability and preserving wealth.</p>

                    <p>An accounting system is both a structure, and a series of transactions. People constantly remark to Madeline, "No matter what accounting problem I throw at you, you know how to solve it". That's because a business analyst sees how your business model can be mapped into an accounting system structure. Do you want your accounting system cobbled together or designed? You want it designed. Once Madeline creates a design, any and all transactions fit (or don't fit) into that structure. No matter what's gone on before, no matter how many bookkeepers you've had masticate your business, or how much you obfuscate your business model, Madeline can design an accounting system that works for your business model.</p>

                    <p>A business analyst is more familiar with the world of business than your typical accountant. Whether you want to understand how the IRS "thinks", negotiate with vendors, write your first dunning letter to collect on customer debt, not get overcharged by financial or taxing insituation, or discuss a myrid of problems, Madeline is uniquely qualified to help you find ways to save money without changing the way you conduct business. She will even call for you to negotiate a better deal. Accounting alone saves you thousands of dollars in taxes. Beyond that, Madeline has helped clients make thousands of dollars more in profit as a business analyst. To learn more about business terminology, here is a list of books that Madeline recommends on business, accounting, money, success, and investments. Many books did not make the cut, and every book title includes a short review, so that you can select the ones of interest to you.

                    <h2>A business analysts provides expert collaboration.</h2>
                    <p>One client complained about her lack of profit. After creating more accurate financials, Madeline noticed that her Accounts Receivables were inordinately high. A/R affects cash flow which affects profit. So Madeline focused on the "Open Invoice Report" and showed the client how to get ratios for A/R to Income, Income to Profit, and A/R to Profit. The client came up with the idea of accepting credit cards. Madeline helped her get a merchant account with Intuit so that payments could be processed within QuickBooks for faster bookkeeping. Customers started paying faster, A/R was greatly reduced, and profitability improved. While the client told everyone that, "Madeline is brilliant", clearly, the problem was solved collaboratively.</p>

                    <p>Another client (a couple) complained about an extraordinarily profitable year (or rather the stiff taxes they would face as a result of that profit). Further listening proved that was was originally posed as a business problem was in fact a personal problem between the husband & wife. One partner wanted to relocate the business and incur more expenses that way, while the other partner wanted to stay put even if it meant paying more taxes. It's not possible to separate your private life from being an entrepreneur, so Madeline continued to listen actively until the couple came to an agreement to stay put. At that point, Madeline suggested that they could protect some of their profit from taxes by funding a retirement account. They loved this idea and knew of an investment advisor. The following year, they thanked Madeline profusely. They were both so happy with their decision. Because these clients are famous people, you won't see any mention of their name or a testimonial, but clearly, the problem was solved collaboratively.</p>

                    <h2>Let's create a better future for your business.</h2>
                    <p>Many business owners neglect installing a backup system for critical data. This is a common oversight, but a dangerous one. What would happen if overnight all the data you've been maintaining became inaccessible? It happens more often than you imagine.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1 in 4 computer users will suffer a critical data loss this year.</li>
                        <li>Most data loss is outside your control. For example, a hard drive crashes every 15 seconds.</li>
                        <li>Over 2,000 laptops are stolen or lost every day.</li>
                        <li>Out of all companies that lose their data in a disaster, over 90% are out of business within two years.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>At QC Computing, the ideal backup solution changes with technology. Whatever backup solution we're using today may not be relevant tomorrow, so we stay up on the latest solutions. Everyone here recognizes that your goal is to thrive daily, with no downtime.</p>
