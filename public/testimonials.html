                    <p><i>"Being a bookkeeper is a huge responsibility. It can be really scary. And because the previous accountant wasn't answering my questions, I was put into a position of second-guessing alot of my work in QuickBooks. My manager brought in Madeline as the new accountant. At one point during her first visit, she said, "Don't worry. You are my 150th client. I know exactly what to do." My manager looked at me and we both laughed, because we felt safe. Madeline involved us both in fixing the chart of accounts, so I really understood where to post transactions. She taught me how to create a filing system from scratch that was connected to the chart of accounts. Pretty soon I knew where a piece of paper was located before I got out of my chair, which saved me time and stress. Madeline worked with me until the A/P and A/R were perfect. Eventually, I was reconciling the bank &amp; credit card accounts. Madeline's teaching method was simple: She     listened to every question I had, and answered it with a smile."</i></p>

                <p><i>"When Madeline started, I was shifting my business from paper &amp; pencil to computerized accounting. Madeline was never dismissive of my previous efforts. She was very professional even though we were working at the kitchen table while my showroom was being built. I felt confident and comfortable discussing my business options with her. I want my accounting to be perfect, plus perfect government compliance so I didn't mind Madelines rates getting it setup, but I like saving money with having Shelly doing the bookkeeping. Shelly is so friendly & competent; she's part of my team now. The two of them cover a broader spectrum with me being able to bring in Madeline when I have financial analytical concerns. I feel very organized. I've had the opportunity to grow the business plus now take weekends and vacations off to be with my family. I highly recommend Madeline &amp; Shelly for your small business accounting solution."</i></p>

She is detailed and knowledgeable about accounting practices, especially the use of Quickbooks. She has helped us with getting our Profit/Loss &amp; Balance sheets accurate so that we can make better business decisions in the future. Madeline has also provided me with one on one training so that I know what tools and shortcuts to use in Quickbooks, which in turn has given me the confidence to get our books accurate. I am looking forward to working with her further since I learn something new about Quickbooks and accounting every time she shows up. I am confident that our company will be even more profitable with her help."</i></p>

We attended seminars, hired a QuickBooks consultant who was unable to help us, then hired a C.P.A. who rejected us apologetically because he was also not able to help us. Thank God! I received a mailer from QC Computing. Madeline came out to our company and during the first hour made a drastic improvement! It was a breeze for her to assist us with our nightmare.
