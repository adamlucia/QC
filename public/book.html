Thanks to Radically Simple Accounting, I learned how to develop a chart of accounts - the backbone of bookkeeping and accounting - for my own business, and learned lessons that I can apply to personal finance as well. Madeline explains, in language clear enough for a financial illiterate like myself, the meaning of all the aspects of the chart of accounts and other accounting necessities with definitions, stories, and examples that educate while they entertain. Don't get me wrong this is not a lightweight book, but Madeline does what every good teacher does: she makes it possible to learn a traditionally tough subject with ease! Whether you want to do your own books, bring order to your personal finances, or simply understand what your bookkeeper is up to (an absolute must!), Radically Simple Accounting was a total bargain for what I learned....a great investment in both reading time and money. I keep Radically Simple Accounting handy on my closest bookshelf for review, and I refer to it often. Ill be the first in line to attend Madelines next presentation."</i></p>

I was actually voluntarily sitting at my desk at 6:45 a.m. on a Sunday morning, reading about BOOKKEEPING of all things!! Am taking a break from setting up my first chart of accounts to send you this email. A quick read of your eBook has tremendously raised my comfort level with managing our family and small business bookkeeping tasks, and I wanted to share my appreciation."</i></p>

                                <p><i>"I am so excited about Madeline's book, Radically Simple Accounting. I've read it cover to cover twice, marking it up with stickies and margin notes, and had it open on my lap when I sat down in front of a brand new QB account to create my Chart of Accounts from scratch. The day it all clicked - when I finally got it - when the P&amp;L became clear and it all made sense - I was jumping up and down. I've been self employed for 8 years and until I read her book I thought my Chart of Accounts was just something I kept for my tax preparer so she'd know how much to deduct from my Schedule C. I wanted to understand more about how the finances affect my businesses, but I didn't know where to go to learn. Now I recommend it to everyone who runs his or her own business. It's concise, to the point, and puts all the pieces together. THANK YOU for such an awesome resource and for explaining it so clearly."</i></p>

"Self help" type books should be short enough that the reader does not feel bogged down with information. Radically Simple Accounting is a good example of a book that is just the right length. By using common analogies the author reduces complex information into concepts that are easy to understand. One of the highlights of the book is the way the author provides definitions in the text. It's so nice not to have to flip back and forth to the glossary and one's personal dictionary. The author's personal stories are both a pro and con. The author's professional background is important because it lends credibility to the book, but it could be removed from the main portion of the book and included in a biographical section. The glossary at the back of the book is a nice addition and makes the book easy to use as a reference at a later date."</i></p>

                <h2>Accounting is the Language of Business</h2>
                <p>Being accounting-illiterate can cost you dearly. Ignore your accounting and you may find yourself overpaying vendors, undercharging customers, overpaying employees, bouncing checks, paying too much in taxes, getting audited, paying late fees and interest on past taxes, paying too much in bank charges, interest and credit card finance charges, and even allowing fraud to persist. Did you know that taxes are the biggest expense for most business people? Poor accounting management can even cause the successful business you've worked so hard to build to go down the tubes. As an experienced accountant, Madeline Bailey has seen hundreds of people make the same accounting mistakes over and over again, losing quite a lot of money in the process. That's why she wrote Radically Simple Accounting for people who can't quite "connect" with traditional accounting books and want something modern.</p>

                <h2>A Way out of the dark and into the Profit</h2>
                <p>Dubbed the first user-friendly accounting book, Radically Simple Accounting introduces a simpler way to learn accounting that successful people from students to stars find engaging.  Whether you are doing your own bookkeeping, or managing a bookkeeper, this book will empower you financially.  This accounting primer works with ALL accounting software. (QuickBooks tips and tricks are included as side-notes.)  This accounting primer is useful for all types of private businesses, and for individuals who are a business of one. What is a business of one? If you receive a 1099 tax form, you're classified as a business by the IRS, even if you feel like an employee. Without a good accounting system, you'll grossly overpay taxes. On the other hand, it can be advantageous tax-wise to be classified as a business, but only if you learn how to take the proper write-off's against your income. Also, these days our private financial lives are so complicated that many individuals and families are in essence, a business of one.</p>

                <h2>Is this right for me? I'm not the "Radical" type...</h2>
                <p>The truth is, traditional accounting practices used today were invented in 1492. Accounting is not an industry where things are often shaken up by new ways of thinking. You may have checked out the regular accounting books, and found that they read like appliance repair manuals. They don't relate to your small business problems or how you think as a small business owner. Even small business owners with MBA's can sometimes not translate traditional accounting debits and credits into their way of doing business.  As an entrepreneur who lacked quality accounting, Madeline Bailey has walked in your shoes. She developed this new methodology with the help of small business clients, from pre-profit startups to millionaires, before codifying it as a systematic approach.  That's why the best solution has to be Radical!</p>

                <p>Of course you do. That's why you're walked step by step through creating your own chart of accounts. A chart of accounts is a list of categories. Your chart of accounts is the backbone of your accounting system. Once your chart of accounts is correct, you will understand your GAAP financial reports, specifically your Profit and Loss Report, and Balance Sheet. Your financial reports are your business scorecards. Are you winning or losing when it comes to your business finances? Is your bookkeeper and financial advisor making sense, or are they talking nonsense? After you read this book, you'll know.</p>
                <p>Whatever your numbers, GAAP financial reports prove to financial advisors such as venture capitalists, loan officers, CPAs, tax experts, angel investors, and portfolio investment advisors that you are "in the game", know the rules, and have what it takes to win.</p>
